## Problem Statement
Studying alone can be challenging, and many students benefit from collaborative learning. However, organizing study groups can be difficult due to:

- **Disorganized Communication**: Students often rely on various messaging apps or emails, leading to missed messages and confusion.
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: Coordinating study sessions can be time-consuming, especially when trying to find a common time for all members.
- **Resource Sharing**: Students may struggle to share study materials and resources efficiently.

## Proposed Solution
The **Virtual Study Group Platform** addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Centralized Group Management**: A single platform for users to create, join, and manage study groups.
- **Scheduling Tools**: Users can easily schedule study sessions and send notifications to group members.
- **Resource Sharing**: A feature to upload and share study materials, notes, and links.
- **Communication Tools**: Integrated chat functionality for real-time discussions and collaboration.

## Core Features

### **User Management**
- Create, view, update, and delete user profiles.
- Set preferences for subjects and topics of interest.

### **Group Management**

## Database Table Relationships
The platform will use the following database relationships:

- **Users and Groups** (One-to-Many)
  - A user can be a member of multiple study groups.
  - Each study group can have multiple users.

- **Groups and Sessions** (One-to-Many)
  - A group can have multiple scheduled study sessions.
  - Each session belongs to only one group.
